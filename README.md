# About-Me

I discovered the world of programming and software development in my junior year of high school and quickly became obsessed, gathering skills with web and game development before committing to a career in the field.

I tested my skills and found true passion for programming when I took up Harvard's Intro to Computer Science course, which was equal parts intellectually stimulating, challenging, and fulfilling.

I took my skills and began developing small games after school and manipulating data from various applications such as Discord to explore data and solve day-to-day tasks.

It was when I began attending the University of Illinois at Chicago that I discovered my ultimate goal to teach and inspire through innovation. I intend not only on pursuing a career in softeware engineering, but to help my peers and the next generation in learning and seeing the logical and analytical beauty of computer science and programming. I want to change the world of software for the betterment of people's daily lives.

Highly skilled with data manipulation, algorithms, and object-oriented programming:
